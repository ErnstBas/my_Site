This project is about developing a personal portfolio website that comprises projects and blog posts.
It is build in Django.

The purpose of this project is:
- learning Django (probably a static site would be easier :))
- setting up a minimalist portfolio site
- make it responsive for mobile use
- eventually add more functionality, like search options, improve the database, etc.
